# Bouncing Balls Physics Simulation

A clean and simple HTML Canvas physics simulation written in pure JavaScript.  
Multiple balls fall with gravity, collide realistically, slide with friction, display their velocity as arrows, and increment a live collision counter.

## Features
- Gravity-based movement  
- Realistic elastic collisions (with friction and impulse)  
- Velocity arrow visualization  
- Live collision counter  
- Ball spawning system  
- Reset function  
- 100% Vanilla JavaScript, no external libraries

## Controls
- **spawnBall()** – spawns a new ball  
- **resetAll()** – clears all balls and resets the collision counter

## Purpose
Useful for learning and experimenting with:
- 2D vector math  
- Collision detection and resolution  
- Impulse and friction simulation  
- Canvas rendering  
- Basic game-physics systems
